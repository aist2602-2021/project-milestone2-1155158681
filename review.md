**Good things to learn about GitHub!**

One thing about Workshop 6:
*Why did my code gave >100% confidence??*
The code is included in the repository.
I typed out the code in the slides, and added lots of (probably too much) layers to it.

With 2 relu layers are fine with <5% confidence.
But with 5 relu layers making it weird??
